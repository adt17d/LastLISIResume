	 <h3>Malibu House VR Tour: I was an assistant developer for this Tour, My role was to set up the 360 degree camera in different areas. The main challenege of this project was figuring out where every point of view should be. I leaened a great deal about immersive media throughout this project</h3>
	 <h3>Sales Training Greeting: For this project my main role was as a lead developer for a comprehensive sales training curriculum. The main challenegs I faced were learning how to use the software articulate 360 in order to create this.</h3>
	<h3>Sales and Leadership Training: This project was the proposal that was built right before we started to develop the modules. I was an assistant in designing this proposal as well as filling it with content. The main challenges I faced were learning how to approach a business owner with an idea and how to make it as transparent as possible. </h3>
	<h3>Strategic Breif: For this project, I worked on a team to figure out the best way to guide the building of the sales and leadership training proposal, this was by far the most challenging part. I played a main role in creating the content for this brief as well as creating the backschedule for project management. </h3>
